# SES 598 Midterm Submission

## Summary

This code will fly the drone around the PBR to map it. It then goes to a location near the probe, and uses a color filter to detect it. Once the probe is detection, visual servoing will kick in to push the drone so that the center of the probe is within 40 pixels of the center of the image. It then flies to the rover, and lands by descending on top of it.
